     <p><strong>Learn how to use your every surface of your foot as you learn to play soccer. If you are quickly dribbling, then you are likely using the front of your foot at the instep. If you’d like to dribble better, the outside and the inside of your foot must be used. This technique enables you to direct the ball in a direction away from any defensive pressure and gives more control.</p>
        <p><strong>Take Responsibility for Your Improvement<p><strong>
         <p>Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world. Millions of people enjoy watching soccer and millions love playing it.

    <p>here are some of the best players in the wolrd these players really changed the way of futbol.</p>
    <p>:Soccer legend Pelé became a superstar with his performance in the 1958 World Cup. Pelé played professionally in Brazil for two decades, winning three World Cups along the way, before joining the New York Cosmos late in his career. Named FIFA co-Player of the Century in 1999, he is a global ambassador for soccer and other humanitarian causes.</p>
    <p>:Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17. He helped the club win two successive Campeonato Paulista championships, a Copa do Brasil, and the 2011 Copa Libertadores; the latter being Santos' first since 1963. Neymar was twice named the South American Footballer of the Year, in 2011 and 2012, and soon relocated to Europe to join Barcelona. As part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 for his performances. He then attained a domestic double in the 2015–16 season. Motivated to be a talisman at club level, Neymar transferred to PSG in 2017 and was handed the number 10 jersey.[9] The move cost €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] In France, he won four league titles, among other honours, and was voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year in his debut season.[12] Notably, he helped PSG attain a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, and led the club to its first ever Champions League Final. Neymar currently stands as PSG's sixth-highest-goalscorer of all time and seventh-highest-assister of all time.</p>
    <p>Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based club.</p>
